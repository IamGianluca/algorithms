# Collection of Computer Science and Machine Learning algorithms

This is a small repository which I use to keep track of some algorithms I've learned over the years. These are hardly as fast as some optimised versions you can find in popular Machine Learning libraries -- such as [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) -- so if you're looking for some stuff you can use in production I would recommend you to look elsewhere.

The only reason why I've created this repo is that I want to learn how each of these algorithms work, and coding them is the best way for me to learn it. Afterall if you can write a program that does that you probably understood it.

Feel free to send a Pull Request if you think one of the implementation can be improved, or add an Issue if you see any bug or have a suggestion you would like to discuss.
